# Option-Strategies
Option strategies are investment techniques used by traders to profit from changes in the price of underlying assets without actually owning them. Python is a popular programming language for financial analysis and can be used to implement various option strategies. 
Long Call: A long call option strategy involves buying a call option on a stock or other underlying asset with the expectation that the price will increase. 
Long Put: A long put option strategy involves buying a put option on a stock or other underlying asset with the expectation that the price will decrease.
Covered Call: A covered call option strategy involves buying a stock and selling a call option on that stock. The goal is to earn income from the option premium while also benefiting from any increase in the stock price. 
Protective Put: A protective put option strategy involves buying a put option on a stock that you already own. The put option acts as insurance against a potential decline in the stock price.
Butterfly Spread: A butterfly spread option strategy involves buying and selling multiple call or put options with the same expiration date and different strike prices. The goal is to profit from a narrow range of prices for the underlying asset. 
Iron Condor: An iron condor option strategy involves buying and selling multiple call and put options with different strike prices and expiration dates. The goal is to profit from a range-bound market.
